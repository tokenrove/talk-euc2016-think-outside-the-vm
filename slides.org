* Profiling in Prod is Hard

- In-VM tools interfere with system operation
  - caveat: OTP 19 tracing facilities should improve the situation, and will only get better
- it's difficult to simulate system under load outside of prod


* Using out-of-VM tools on the VM

- We can use perf and other out-of-VM tools to get ideas of what we can try optimizing

* Linking experiments

- now we can conduct experiments in the small, and try to demonstrate a correlation
- identify KPI: what is measured improves
- beware Goodhart's Law: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure

* Idea

- slow things down to demonstrate correlations before we try to speed things up

* Integrating perf and Erlang

- flamegraphs here

* How bad is the skid?

- measurements here
- all tools can print an estimate


* ftrace'ing mmap instead of using strace
* Other tricks

- comparing allocator stats w/mmap sizes, fragmentation
- printing the current stack on each scheduler
- kcov for coverage in production

* Next Steps
